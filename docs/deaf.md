## Invisible disabilites

Special issues for impaired
- they must have the courage to ask for help and not pretend to be ok
- foreign languages are hard to understand and speak

Special issues for others
- theycannot know who is deaf 
- they never know if and when a deaf person understands correctly


### Auditive Impairment

We distinguish between deaf (people who becae deaf but can read / write / speak) and Deaf (people who are deaf from birth and commiucate with sign language).
- they cannot follow discussions in a group
- they cannot at the same time read subtitles (closed captions) - sing translator and follow for example a video or shared screen
- they cannot code and listen to someone at the same time 


#### Beeing deaf means

Presentations:
As speaker I want not manxy slides (death per powerpoint) but deaf peple like many slides. 
You can do this: 
- Prepare a doc for auditive impaired people where they can read during presentation
- Have a translator who writes simultaneously and the deaf person can read (ther are apps .. but don't know what)

Team work
- Speak slowly
- Avoid standing with your back to the light (lips are harder to see in backlight).

Organisator: 
- reading from lips is possible if there is bright light





#### Beeing Deaf means
